# factory_bot is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward
# definition syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved
# instances, unsaved instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed
# objects), and support for multiple factories for the same class
# (user, admin_user, and so on), including factory inheritance.
